  This may happen if you're using rubygems as your package manager, but it is not
  being required through some mechanism before executing the rspec command.

  You may need to do one of the following in your shell:

    # for bash/zsh
    export RUBYOPT=rubygems

    # for csh, etc.
    set RUBYOPT=rubygems
#{'*'*50}
  EOS
  exit(1)
end

  scanner = Gitdo::Scanner.new(ARGV[0])
  reporter = Gitdo::ConsoleReporter.new(scanner)
  reporter.run!
else
  puts "Usage: gitdo [path]"
end
